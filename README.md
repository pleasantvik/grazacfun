The design must be responsive on screen device

### Built with

The project was built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox

### My Approach

I took the desktop first layout approach and then tailored down to mobile approach.

I also used the BEM model so as to have a maintainable code

### Continued development

Only the landing page is done in this project. I planned on adding other pages and also probably add some functionality to it as soon as i learn DOM manipulation in javaScript
